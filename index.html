            <img src="Profile-1.jpg" alt="">
         
            <p>Hello! I'm Miguel Topete, a passionate and dedicated human being based in Spokane, Washington. My days are filled with work. I am a full time hair-sylist able to craft styles and build connections as a barber, bringing out the best in my clients. Congruent to this I am also a full-time student at Eastern Washington University, currently in my junior year, where I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Design.
    <p>
    At 39, I've embraced the journey of lifelong learning, merging my practical experience with academic knowledge to create innovative and functional designs. My diverse background in barbering has honed my eye for detail and creativity, skills I now apply to my studies and design projects.</p>
    
    <p>My goal is to leverage my degree to blend artistry and functionality, creating impactful designs that resonate with people and stand the test of time. I'm excited about the future and eager to see where this journey in design takes me. Whether behind the barber's chair or at the design table, I strive to make a positive difference in the lives of those around me.</p>
